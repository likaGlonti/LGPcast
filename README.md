### Reflection:

This was a 1-week long project built during our third year of university. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with documentation for new features. The context of the ‘LGPcast’ is to provide users with a free platform where they can listen to a variety of podcasts.

Initially, we wanted to build an application that allowed users to see data from the API of Podcasts, after they choose the genre, they were interested in listening and going to the podcast page where they can change between podcasts. Firstly, when you open the app there is a dashboard where you can choose between multiple genres, if you click one of those it will direct you to a new space where you can see specific genres. On a dashboard, we also have podcasts where you can choose one from the variety and listen to it by clicking on pictures. When you select the podcast, you can change it by swiping right and after that, you will be directed to another podcast.
